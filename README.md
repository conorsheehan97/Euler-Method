# Euler-Method
Here we implement the Euler method for approximating ODE solutions. We use an OOP approach for a single function, and then compare the result to the anlaytical solution.

We declare an Euler class, with methods for setting the interval width, initial value conditions, calulating the maximum number of iterations, and final an Euler implementation method. In this method, we print the approximation value at every interval value, as well as save the results to a text file. We then use this text file to plot the prediction using Python's matplotlib library, and compare this result to the Analytical solution obtained using Wolfram Alpha's ODE solver.
